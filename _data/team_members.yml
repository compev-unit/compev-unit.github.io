  bio: <br> Kristian is Assistant Professor at Aarhus University, Department of Political Science. In his research, he primarily seeks to answer why citizens sometimes support politicians who break democratic principles, why citizens sometimes oppose democratic norm violations, and shed light on citizens’ involvement in processes of both democratic backsliding and restoration. He has fielded several cross-country survey experiments to answer such questions. Besides these specific research interests, his broader interest is comparative politics, political behavior, and causal inference.

  email: allinger@ps.au.dk
  bio: <br> Tim is a Ph.D. candidate at the Department of Political Science at Aarhus University and a visiting scholar at Princeton University (Spring 2024). In his research, he studies the causes of political extremism and its consequences for democracy and society more generally. Specifically, he seeks to understand what factors make citizens justify violence against minority groups, and under which conditions this translates into intolerant and extreme forms of behavior. To answer these questions, his research relies on diverse quantitative methods with a focus on innovative experimental and quasi-experimental designs.
