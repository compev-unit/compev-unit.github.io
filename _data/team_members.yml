  bio: Kristian is Assistant Professor at Aarhus University, Department of Political Science. In his research, he primarily seeks to answer why citizens sometimes support politicians who break democratic principles, why citizens sometimes oppose democratic norm violations, and shed light on citizens’ involvement in processes of both democratic backsliding and restoration. He has fielded several cross-country survey experiments to answer such questions. Besides these specific research interests, his broader interest is comparative politics, political behavior, and causal inference.
